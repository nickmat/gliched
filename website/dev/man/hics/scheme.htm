<h2>Statement: scheme</h2>
<p>
 Before any calendar can be used as input or output,
 it must be defined using the 'scheme' definition statement.
 The layout of the statement varies according to the calendar type being defined.
</p>
<p>
 The scheme must be given a unique (within all other schemes) code name
 by which it can be referred to.
 It may then contain the following sub-statements in between '{' and '}' braces.
</p>
<p>
 The scheme must include the base sub-statement.
 Other sub-statements are optional.
</p>

<h3>Sub-Statement: name</h3>
<p>
 Gives a descriptive name to the calendar scheme.
 This name would normally be shown to the user whenever they need to select a scheme.
 Although this statement is optional, any operational scheme should include it.
</p>

<h3>Sub-Statement: base</h3>
<p>
 The Hics extension has the ability to work with with a number of calendars
 and scheme types.
 This list will be extended in the future.

<p>
 The base sub-statement will create one of the built-in calendar schemes.
 These schemes have associated with them a default record containing a fixed number of named fields.
 The record may be extended by adding calculated fields and optional values.
</p>
<p>
 The base-name keyword may be followed by further keywords which further define the scheme.
 These are detailed below with the base-name description.
</p>
<p>
 All base sub-statements may include the location keyword.
 This pinpoints an exact location for identifying the local time.
 This may be needed for calculating astronomical features required by the scheme.
 For example the day that a new moon occurs.
 Unless otherwise stated, the default location is the Greenwich Observatory, England.

<h4>Sub-Statement: base jdn</h4>
<p>
 This sub-statement implements the Julian Day Number day count calendar.
 The calendar has a record with a single fixed field named 'day'.
 If a field is used to represent a date in the script,
 then by default it is a jdn (Julian Day Number).
</p>

<h4>Sub-Statement: base jwn</h4>
<p>
 This sub-statement implements a Julian Week Number day count calendar.
 There no known use of this calendar outside of Glich and is included
 for completeness. The calendar has a record with two fixed fields
 named 'week' and 'day'.
</p>
<p>
 Week days are normally handles by other schemes as an optional field.
 The optional field names depend on the day the week starts.

</p>

<h4>base gregorian Sub-Statement</h4>

<h4>base chinese Sub-Statement</h4>
<p>
 This sub-statement implements the lunisolar Chinese calendar.
 The calendar has a record with five fixed fields named 'cycle', 'cyear', 'month', 'lmonth' and 'day',
 ranked in that order.
 
 A cycle is divided into 60 Chinese years (cyear).
 The year is divided into 12 lunar months in a common year and one month is repeated in a leap year.
 The lmonth field is always zero, 
 except in a leap year when the during the repeated month it has the value of 1.
 Each month starts on the day of the new moon and has 29 or 30 days.
 The epoch is jdn# 758326 (jce:dmy# 8 Mar 2637 BCE).
 See the default script for the <a href='../defs/c.htm'>Chinese calendar</a> for more details.
</p>

<h3>epoch Shift Sub-Statement</h3>
<p>
 Calendars normally have two separate parts to their definitions.
 There is the definition that describes how the days are counted within the year,
 then there is the method of counting those years.
 One common occurrence is that different calendar schemes may use the same method
 to count the days with the year but very different ways of counting the years.
 The year count may start at any point of the year,
 not just the point normally considered the start of the year (New Years Day).
</p>
<p>
 For instance, when Julius Caesar introduced the Julian calendar,
 New Years Day was considered to be 1st January.
 However, not all calendar systems increased the year count on this day.
 When the AD (Anno Domini) Julian calendar was first used,
 the year change occurred on the 25th December.
 Later, many other dates were used, for instance, 25th March,
 the Feast of the Annunciation.
</p>
<p>
 We can also use the epoch variant to change the era,
 even if the year change remains the 1st January,
 as with the <a href='../defs/se.htm'>Julian Spanish Era</a> calendar.
 It will also work with day count calendars,
 to create day count calendar that starts at a different date,
 such as the Modified Julian Day calendar.
</p>

<p>
 The sub-statement consists of the 'epoch' keyword followed by the epoch date
 followed by the base scheme.
</p>
<table class='code'>

    grammar jepoch;
}
</td></tr>

<h3>hybrid Sub-Statement</h3>
<p>
 When an authority changes from calender system to another,
 and where the underling system is the same,
 we can create a hybrid calender.
 This occurred quite often with the Julian and Gregorian calenders.
 Not only do they switch between them,
 they may also change the year count change date.
</p>
<p>
 In order for a hybrid calendar to be useful,
 the change over must occur in an organised way, on a particular day.
 Where it is possible, a hybrid calendar can simplify things.
</p>
<p>
 The hybrid calendar has the appearance of adding or removing days from the calender.
 On the occasions that days are added, this produces an ambiguity.
 When one of these ambiguities occurs,
 entering a date produces two possible results.
 An additional element is required to indicate the required day,
 for example, the scheme being used.
 Alternatively, something like the day of the week can be added.
</p>
<p>
 The sub-statement consists of a sequence of further sub-statements between braces,
 starting with a 'fields' statement that lists the fields used.
 This is followed by the initial 'scheme' statement,
 followed by one or more 'change' and 'scheme' statement pairs.
</p>
<table class='code'>
<tr><th>Example Script</th></tr> <!-- See test/xxxx.hcs -->
<tr><td

</table>
<p>
 Note, a schemes must either be defined before use,
 or created in place anonymously.
</p>

<h3>regnal Sub-Statement</h3>
<p>
 A common method of numbering the years in a calendar
 is to number them from the start of the reign of a monarch or official.
 Such calendars are still in use today.
</p>
<p>
 A calendar based on this system is really a sequence of shifted calendars,
 the era of each based on the start of the reign.
 We can also specify the date range covered by each era,
 which may overlap or have gaps.
 A default calendar is also defined and is used if no suitable range is found.
</p>
<table class='basic'>
<tr><th colspan='2'>regnal Sub-Statement</th></tr>
<tr><th>Sub-Statement</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td class='code'>regnal { fields <i>name1</i>, <i>name2</i>, <i>name3</i>; ... }</td><td class='example'>fields year, month, day;</td></tr>
<tr><td class='code'>regnal { ... extended <i>name1</i>, <i>name2</i>; ... }</td><td class='example'>extended hyear;</td></tr>
<tr><td class='code'>regnal { ... fixed <i>date.field</i> = <i>value</i>; ... }</td><td class='example'>fixed year = 1;</td></tr>
<tr><td class='code'>regnal { ... era { <i>era-sub-statements</i> } }</td><td class='example'>era { scheme j; } // Julian default scheme</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>grammar Sub-Statement</h3>
<p>
 This can be used to link to a previously defined grammar (using its grammar code)
 or to define an anonymous grammar.
 One or zero grammar sub-statements can be defined.
</p>

<h3>style Sub-Statement</h3>
<p>
 Set style attributes for the Scheme.
 The default is style none.
</p>
<table class='basic'>
 <tr><th colspan='2'>style Sub-Statement</th></tr>
 <tr><th>Description</th><th>Switch</th></tr>
 <tr><td>No style settings.</td><td class='code'>style none;</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Do not show the scheme in the scheme list.</td><td class='code'>style hide;</td></tr>
